# How to Contribute (Super Easy GitHub-Only Method)

## 1. Fork the Project  
This creates your own editable copy.

```
Click Fork → GitHub makes your copy → Done
```

If you don’t know what GitHub is, watch this Microsoft Masterpiece quick intro:

## 2. Open the README in Your Fork  
1. In your fork, click **README.md**  
2. Click the **✏️ pencil icon** (top-right of the file) to edit it

## 3. Add Your Name  
Scroll to the **Contributors List** and add a line like:

```
* [YourName](https://github.com/YourUsername)
```
Example:
```
* [Sohaibdevv](https://github.com/sohaibdevv)
```

That’s the only change you need to make.

## 4. Commit Your Change  
At the bottom of the page:

- Write a simple message:  
  `Add my name to contributors list`
- Click **Commit changes**

GitHub saves it automatically.

## 5. Create Your Pull Request (PR)
